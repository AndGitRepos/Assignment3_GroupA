# What Kensington is doing to reduce crime through the use of education
- Restorative practices and workshops in schools to prevent reoffending and de-escalate conflicts.
- Early intervention programs to address behavioral issues before they lead to criminal activity.
- Access to inner-city grants for addressing youth crime, enabling programs like PSHE enhancements and community-based mentoring. Havering relies more heavily on council budgets and limited high-needs funding.

# What Havering can do to improve their crime rates
- Workshops in schools: "Youth Violence and Exploitation Strategy 2022-2025"/ "2020 Dreams" workshops
- Gang and knife crime prevention workshops
- Youth mentorship programs: pairs students with community leaders, ex-offenders or other professionals to provide guidance and act as positive role models
- Community policing and school collaboration: Regular police visits and discussions in schools help deter crime and build relationships
- Seek External Funding: Apply for grants from national initiatives and charity organizations to supplement council funding.
